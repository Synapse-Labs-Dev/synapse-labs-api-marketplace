# OpenTensor API & PaaS

This repository is designed to provide simple and easy-to-use templates (PaaS -- Product as a Service) for validators which enables:

- API endpoints to Bittensor subnet services and digital commodities

- Frontend and Backend templates

- Monetization with stripe integration

NOTE: At present, you have to manually configure your own validator to route the requests to. Reach out to koyuki@opentensor.dev for further assistance. In addition, if you need a customized design & UI beyond the templates given, the OTF team is here to help.
